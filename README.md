# Lessons Learned


While developing this application, I encountered several challenges and encountered new components. Given that this was my third official application in React Native, my knowledge was still incomplete. Nevertheless, I endeavored to create a dice roll game where the user must equalize all the dice numbers in order to win. To facilitate this, I incorporated a feature to lock the dice. During the implementation of this feature, I deepened my understanding of conditional rendering and further honed my skills in managing state with useState. Additionally, I delved into the functionality of 'PropsWithChildren', familiarized myself with the Pressable component, and was introduced to the 'ReactNativeHapticFeedback' npm package.
